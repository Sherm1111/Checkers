<!-- ABOUT PROJECT -->
## About Project

This project ecnompasses the implementation of the game Checkers using the Python scripting language, the module tkinter, and GPIO input from a breadboard to the Raspberry Pi 3b.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This section contains information regarding the creation and use of this project: how we built the enclosure, how we synthesized compatability with the breadboard, the total expenditure of monetary resources for the materials of the project, the installation of this software, and more.

### Prerequisites

<b> Hardware necessary for the project </b>
1. A square board with dimensions 0.20"x23.88"x23.88"
2. A Raspberry Pi 3b or other compatible device
3. A screen capable of displaying output from the Raspberry Pi or other compatible device
5. A screwdriver kit
6. Access to a laser cutter that can read .dfx files
7. Small latches with dimensions [dimensions]
8. Buttons and a joystick from Amazon or competing retailer

<b> Software necessary for the project </b>

1. The latest version of Python, which can be downloaded below:
  ```sh
  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.4/python-3.9.4-amd64.exe
  ```
2. The following .dfx file:
   ```sh
   link to download of .dfx file
   ```
  
<b> Total cost for project </b>

EMBED A PICTURE WITH THE RECEIPTS AND TOTAL COST HERE!

### Installation

We need to discuss how we utilized the materials (soldering, laser cutting, and more), etc.
1. Run the previously downloaded executable file for Python 3.X and install Python
2. Load the command prompt and install tkinter via the following command:
   ```sh
   py -m pip install tkinter
   ```
3. From the github project, download (FILE WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN UPLOADED)
4. Unzip the downloaded folder to a preferred location
5. Load IDLE and open the .py file with name "main" stored inside the folder saved at the preferred location mentioned in step 4
6. Select run

### Building

1. Load the .dfx file to a machine that can laser-cut the design for the enclosure of the Raspberry Pi 3b
2. Cut the wooden planks
3. Stain cut pieces and let dry
4. Assemble cut pieces for the enclosure
5. Use a screwdriver to create a hole in the bottom-left corner of the back of the enclosure
6. etc.
7. etc.
8. etc.

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features

The main program included in this project implements the game Checkers.
Players of the game may utilize a single joystick and pair of buttons to move pieces around the board and approve or decline their movements.
This version of the game follows the standard rules of the game, such that:
1. A player may move single pieces diagonally only one space unless he or she is taking his or her opponent's piece(s), in which case a player may skip several places in one turn.
2. Other rule
3. Other rule
4. Other rule

Other information about the rules of the game can be found below:
